# Covid-19-Max-Infection-rate-visualization
Work with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. 
Also, work with another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. 
Merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
